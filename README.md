#Sorting-Visualizer
Interactive web app showcasing sorting algorithms inner workings.Dive deep into the inner workings of various sorting algorithms, visualize their step-by-step processes, and compare their efficiencies.

Implemented Sorting Algorithms: Bubble sort Selection sort Insertion sort Merge sort Quick sort Heap sort

Features: Visual indication of each step's execution: Blue: Default Yellow: Comparison Red: Incorrect position (to be moved) Green: Correct position

Visualization controls: Speed (5 levels) Data size adjustment Random data generation Insights into time and space complexity for each algorithm.
