# Sorting Visualizer

Interactive web app showcasing sorting algorithms' inner workings. Dive deep into the inner workings of various sorting algorithms, visualize their step-by-step processes, and compare their efficiencies.

(1)Implemented Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble sort
Selection sort
Insertion sort
Merge sort
Quick sort
Heap sort
Features:

(2)Visual indication of each step's execution:
Blue: Default
Yellow: Comparison
Red: Incorrect position (to be moved)
Green: Correct position

(3)Visualization controls:
Speed (5 levels)
Data size adjustment
Random data generation

(3)Insights into time and space complexity for each algorithm.
